  "readme": "# Cylon.js For Sphero\n\nCylon.js (http://cylonjs.com) is a JavaScript framework for robotics and physical computing using Node.js\n\nThis module provides an adaptor and driver for the Sphero robot from Orbotix (http://www.gosphero.com/). It uses the Hybrid Group fork of the Spheron module (https://github.com/hybridgroup/spheron) originally created by [@alchemycs](https://github.com/alchemycs)\n\nWant to use Ruby on robots? Check out our sister project Artoo (http://artoo.io)\n\nWant to use the Go programming language to power your robots? Check out our sister project Gobot (http://gobot.io).\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hybridgroup/cylon-sphero.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/hybridgroup/cylon-sphero)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nInstall the module with: `npm install cylon-sphero`\n\n## Examples\n\n### JavaScript:\n```javascript\nvar Cylon = require('cylon');\n\nCylon.robot({\n  connection: { name: 'sphero', adaptor: 'sphero', port: '/dev/rfcomm0' },\n  device: {name: 'sphero', driver: 'sphero'},\n\n  work: function(my) {\n    every((1).second(), function() { \n      my.sphero.roll(60, Math.floor(Math.random() * 360));\n    });\n  }\n}).start();\n```\n\n### CoffeeScript:\n```\nCylon = require 'cylon'\n\nCylon.robot\n  connection:\n    name: 'sphero', adaptor: 'sphero', port: '/dev/rfcomm0'\n\n  device:\n    name: 'sphero', driver: 'sphero'\n\n  work: (my) ->\n    every 1.second(), ->\n      my.sphero.roll 60, Math.floor(Math.random() * 360)\n\n.start()\n```\n\n## How To Connect\n\n### OSX\n\nIn order to allow Cylon.js running on your Mac to access the Sphero, go to \"Bluetooth > Open Bluetooth Preferences > Sharing Setup\" and make sure that \"Bluetooth Sharing\" is checked.\n\nThank you to [@kopipejst](https://github.com/kopipejst) for the above connnection info.\n\n### Ubuntu\n\nConnecting to the Sphero from Ubuntu or any other Linux-based OS can be done entirely from the command line\nusing CylonJS CLI commands. Here are the steps.\n\nFind the address of the Sphero, by using:\n```\ncylon bluetooth scan\n```\n\nPair to Sphero using this command (substituting the actual address of your Sphero):\n```\ncylon bluetooth pair <address>\n```\n\nConnect to the Sphero using this command (substituting the actual address of your Sphero):\n```\ncylon bluetooth connect <address>\n```\n\n### Windows\n\nYou should be able to simply pair your Sphero using your normal system tray applet for Bluetooth, and then connect to the COM port that is bound to the device, such as `COM3`.\n\n## How To Calibrate Sphero\n\nYou might want to calibrate the orientation of the Sphero so that it is pointed 'forward'. There are 2 functions that have been added to the Sphero driver to help with this.\n\nCall `startCalibration()` to put the Sphero into 'calibration mode' by turning on the tail LED and turning off the auto-stablization. You can now manually turn the Sphero to so the tail LED is pointed to the rear of the direction in which you want the Sphero to go.\n\nCall `finishCalibration()` to turn off 'calibration mode' by turning off the tail LED and turning back on the auto-stablization. Whichever direction that the tail LED was pointed, is now the rear direction for the Sphero.\n\n## Documentation\nWe're busy adding documentation to our web site at http://cylonjs.com/ please check there as we continue to work on Cylon.js\n\nThank you!\n\n## Contributing\n\n* All patches must be provided under the Apache 2.0 License\n* Please use the -s option in git to \"sign off\" that the commit is your work and you are providing it under the Apache 2.0 License\n* Submit a Github Pull Request to the appropriate branch and ideally discuss the changes with us in IRC.\n* We will look at the patch, test it out, and give you feedback.\n* Avoid doing minor whitespace changes, renamings, etc. along with merged content. These will be done by the maintainers from time to time but they can complicate merges and should be done seperately.\n* Take care to maintain the existing coding style.\n* Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality & Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).\n* All pull requests should be \"fast forward\"\n  * If there are commits after yours use “git rebase -i <new_head_branch>”\n  * If you have local changes you may need to use “git stash”\n  * For git help see [progit](http://git-scm.com/book) which is an awesome (and free) book on git\n\n## Release History\n\nVersion 0.9.1 - Added new 'locator' event, changed spheron to hybridgroup-spheron module\n\nVersion 0.9.0 - Update for cylon 0.12.0\n\nVersion 0.8.1 - Update dependencies to include npm version of Spheron with Cylon.js pull requests\n\nVersion 0.8.0 - Update for cylon 0.11.0, migrated to pure JS\n\nVersion 0.7.0 - Update for cylon 0.10.0, add calibration commands\n\nVersion 0.6.0 - Update for cylon 0.9.0\n\nVersion 0.5.0 - Update to match new Spheron module's callback and for cylon 0.8.0\n\nVersion 0.4.0 - Update for cylon 0.7.0\n\nVersion 0.3.0 - Use new Basestar proxying and events\n\nVersion 0.2.0 - Lots of colors, support for entire Sphero API, and uses Basestar for DRY code\n\nVersion 0.1.0 - Initial release for ongoing development\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2013-2014 The Hybrid Group.
