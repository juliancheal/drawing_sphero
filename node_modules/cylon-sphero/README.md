# Cylon.js For Sphero

Cylon.js (http://cylonjs.com) is a JavaScript framework for robotics and physical computing using Node.js

This module provides an adaptor and driver for the Sphero robot from Orbotix (http://www.gosphero.com/). It uses the Hybrid Group fork of the Spheron module (https://github.com/hybridgroup/spheron) originally created by [@alchemycs](https://github.com/alchemycs)

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hybridgroup/cylon-sphero.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/hybridgroup/cylon-sphero)

## Getting Started

Install the module with: `npm install cylon-sphero`

## Examples

### JavaScript:
```javascript
var Cylon = require('cylon');

Cylon.robot({
  connection: { name: 'sphero', adaptor: 'sphero', port: '/dev/rfcomm0' },
  device: {name: 'sphero', driver: 'sphero'},

  work: function(my) {
    every((1).second(), function() { 
      my.sphero.roll(60, Math.floor(Math.random() * 360));
    });
  }
}).start();
```

### CoffeeScript:
```
Cylon = require 'cylon'

Cylon.robot
  connection:
    name: 'sphero', adaptor: 'sphero', port: '/dev/rfcomm0'

  device:
    name: 'sphero', driver: 'sphero'

  work: (my) ->
    every 1.second(), ->
      my.sphero.roll 60, Math.floor(Math.random() * 360)

.start()
```

## How To Connect

### OSX

In order to allow Cylon.js running on your Mac to access the Sphero, go to "Bluetooth > Open Bluetooth Preferences > Sharing Setup" and make sure that "Bluetooth Sharing" is checked.

Thank you to [@kopipejst](https://github.com/kopipejst) for the above connnection info.

### Ubuntu

Connecting to the Sphero from Ubuntu or any other Linux-based OS can be done entirely from the command line
using CylonJS CLI commands. Here are the steps.

Find the address of the Sphero, by using:
```
cylon bluetooth scan
```

Pair to Sphero using this command (substituting the actual address of your Sphero):
```
cylon bluetooth pair <address>
```

Connect to the Sphero using this command (substituting the actual address of your Sphero):
```
cylon bluetooth connect <address>
```

### Windows

You should be able to simply pair your Sphero using your normal system tray applet for Bluetooth, and then connect to the COM port that is bound to the device, such as `COM3`.

## How To Calibrate Sphero

You might want to calibrate the orientation of the Sphero so that it is pointed 'forward'. There are 2 functions that have been added to the Sphero driver to help with this.

Call `startCalibration()` to put the Sphero into 'calibration mode' by turning on the tail LED and turning off the auto-stablization. You can now manually turn the Sphero to so the tail LED is pointed to the rear of the direction in which you want the Sphero to go.

Call `finishCalibration()` to turn off 'calibration mode' by turning off the tail LED and turning back on the auto-stablization. Whichever direction that the tail LED was pointed, is now the rear direction for the Sphero.

* Avoid doing minor whitespace changes, renamings, etc. along with merged content. These will be done by the maintainers from time to time but they can complicate merges and should be done seperately.
* Take care to maintain the existing coding style.
* Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality & Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
* All pull requests should be "fast forward"
  * If there are commits after yours use “git rebase -i <new_head_branch>”
  * If you have local changes you may need to use “git stash”
  * For git help see [progit](http://git-scm.com/book) which is an awesome (and free) book on git
